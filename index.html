<h1>
Saja Hamayel Background Page
</h1>

<p>
My name is Saja Hamayel. I am a 2nd year junior studying Digital Humanities at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I am specializing in Information Architecture as my Digital Humanities specialization and am specializing in history as my traditional humanities specialization. I am also minoring in Biology in order to complete courses that are pre-requisutes for Optometry. I plan on applying to the Illinois College of Optometry this coming summer of 2016 and matriculating into the class of 2017.

<p>
I identify as a Muslim woman. I was born into my religion to Muslim parents and grew up in a community that had a very large population of Muslims and Arab. Attending Illinois Tech was a big move for me as I was not accustomed to so much diversity in religion, race, color, ethnicity, or the varying ideals that people hold. I very much enjoy meeting and interacting with so many different people at IIT
</p>
<p>
I was born in the North side of the city of Chicago and raised in the Southwest suburbs of the city. I attended Universal School in Bridgeview, Illinois from Kindergarden to 12th grade. My parents were born and raised in the suburbs of Ramallah in Palestine. The both immigrated to the United States of America in 1993 after they had studied overseas, married in Palestine, and had given birth to their oldest daughter near their hometown. Although I was not born in Palestine, I still feel a very strong connection to the land and to my family there as I visit Palestine a month or two every year. I consider myslef both Palestinian and American.
</p>
<p>
I graduated from Universal School in 2014. As a high school student, I enjoyed playing on the volleyball and basketball teams. I was also an avid participant and winner in Mathletics regional and state competitions. I was also involved in the WYSE (World Youth in Science and Engineering) team and participated and helped my school win in the regional, sectional, and state competitions in Math, Chemistry, and Physics.

As an Illinois Tech student, I am very involved in planning and attending numerous events on campus. For example, as a Camras scholar, I help incoming freshman during Scholarship weekend as well as attend monthly meetings for Camras scholars. I am also the president of Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and have previously been the PR Director, as well as president Spring of 2015. I am also on the executive board of IIT's Muslim Student Association (MSA).
